        We've been called out by C. Mutonji and family to build up a high platform allowing them to get off the house through the backside door, so we came out with the conception of this 2 levels Deck and we thought of using the room under the upper floor as a secured space of storage with door and locker, all this with a very tight budget, customer and family was mind blown out!
